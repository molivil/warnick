# CHANGE IN RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS
You must edit /etc/systemd/logind.conf and change "RuntimeDirectorySize" directive to.
50% or more. By default, 10% of physical memory is used by the runtime temporary directory.
This may or may not be enough for Warnick to create its temporary log files.
A larger size may be needed for Warnick to run properly.
