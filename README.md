## Installation
### Script prerequisites
- bash, tee, cut, grep, cat, md5sum, date
- wget, curl
- perl
- RuntimeDirectorySize directive in /etc/systemd/logind.conf set to 50% or more

### Mirror from Github
- Have get.sh and getrel.sh mirrored into an empty directory.
- Make a writable subdirectory called "sites".
 
### Change in runtime requirements
You must edit /etc/systemd/logind.conf and change "RuntimeDirectorySize" directive to.
50% or more. By default, 10% of physical memory is used by the runtime temporary directory.
This may or may not be enough for Warnick to create its temporary log files.
A larger size may be needed for Warnick to run properly.

You may use the software any way you would like, just know you do it at your own risk. 
The developer and the project team members may not be held liable for any damages direct or indirect resulting from the use of this software.

## Usage
```
$ get.sh <URL> [datestring] [owner] [maxdepth]
$ get.sh www.domain.com
$ get.sh www.domain.com 1997
$ get.sh www.domain.com 199704
$ get.sh www.domain.com/path_to/file.html 19970411 nobody 5
```
This will mirror the given URL from archive.org under the given path and date,
and store the site files under the subdirectory ./sites/www.domain.com"

## Parameters explained
### URL
Mirror an Wayback Machine URL specified with this parameter.
The "http://" -prefix is not required.

### Datestring
Target a specific date. The targeted date will be used when discovering files
from archive.org. Datestring must be given in YYYYMMDD format. You may omit
the month and day.

### Owner 
This sets the job owner for the script. Use "nobody" here at all times, unless the script is used as part of a web integration in a multiuser environment.

### Maxdepth
Override the default maxdepth value specified with the $defaultmaxdepth environment variable. 

This sets the default maximum depth hardlimit, and will exit the subprocess once the limit has been reached. If the site is large, do not use much more than 5 or 6 here, to prevent the script from entering seemingly neverending infinite loops. In many cases a page that is 5 links deep can be reached from a page that is at a shallower depth, unless the web site happens to be a portal, so it should be relatively safe to use a lower value here, such as 4 or 5.

## Important!
If you specify a maxdepth, you must also specify an owner. Owner must "nobody",
or $defaultowner, unless used in a multi-user environment in a web integration.
